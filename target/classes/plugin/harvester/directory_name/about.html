    <p>This plugin harvests subdirectory names in a specified 
       directory in the file system. It can use a cache to do 
       incremental harvests, which only harvest directories that have been
       added since the last time it was run.
 
       The directory name harvested is used in conjunction with a default 
       metadata file (default-metadata.json) to create metadata about 
       the directory.
 
       Each directory harvested, may contain an override metadata file 
       (metadata.json) to replace the default metadata or even add to the
       default metadata.
 
       This harvester was built to harvest bird species where standard 
       metadata applied to each species, but an override file may exist to 
       provide replacement or additional metadata details.
 
       Both the default metadata and override metadata files can contain 
       multiple types of metadata to be created for each species. A unique
       record is created for each metadata type detected.
 
       The caching used is the same as that from the File System Harvester.
