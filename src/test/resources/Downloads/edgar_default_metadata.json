Each occurrence record has been checked against these ranges and an assertion added against each record to label whether it is core breeding habitat, non-breeding, historic, irruptive, or invasive. Records that fall outside these ranges were marked as invalid and excluded.\n\nOccurrence records were plotted spatially and displayed online for further vetting from experts.\n\nEvery 6 months the occurrence record download file is updated to reflect recent vetting by experts. In the data download, sensitive records have been obfuscated by truncating the lat/long to two decimal places. Obfuscated records will be indicated in the data file. Access to the accurate data will need to be arranged with the original data owners - contact the ALA for more information.\n\nThe resulting downloadable file of occurrence records reflects which records are suitable for species distribution modelling.

Only species with >20 unique spatiotemporal records were used for modelling. Monthly precipitation and temperature minima and maxima from 1975 until 2005 at a 0.05° grid scale were accessed from the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP - http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/awap/) (Jones et al 2007, Grant et al 2008), and downscaled to a 0.01° grid. From this, we calculated annual mean temperature, temperature seasonality, max and min monthly temperature, annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality, and precipitation of the wettest and driest quarters for current. The same were generated for all RCP scenarios (RCP3PD, RCP45, RCP6, RCP85) at 8 time steps between 2015 and 2085. https://eresearch.jcu.edu.au/tdh/data/633b4ccd-2e78-459d-963c-e43d3c8a5ca1\n\nSpecies distribution models were run using the presence-only modelling program Maxent (Phillips et al 2006). Maxent uses species presence records to statistically relate species occurrence to environmental variables on the principle of maximum entropy. All default settings were used except for background point allocation. We used a target group background (Phillips & Dudik 2008) to remove any spatial or temporal sampling bias in the modelling exercise."
